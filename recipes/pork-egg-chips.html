    <p>We've updated a pub classic with this pork, egg and chips recipe. Top tender pork loin steaks with juicy caramelised pineapple and a perfectly fried egg, then serve with peas and crispy chips for a simple family dinner idea.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600g frozen chips</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 pork loin steaks</li>
        <li>1 onion, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>4 rings of tinned pineapple</li>
        <li>350g frozen peas</li>
        <li>15g mint, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 8, 220’C, fan 200’C. Place the chips on a large baking tray in an even layer. Cook for 20-25 mins until golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large, ovenproof frying pan over a high heat. Season the pork loin steaks and add to the pan along with the onion wedges. Fry the pork for 2 mins per side until lightly golden. Place a pineapple slice on top of each pork loin. Place the frying pan into the oven, under the tray with the chips, for 8 mins or until the pork is cooked through. Set aside to rest for 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Bring a saucepan of slightly salted water to the boil and add the peas. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, until tender, then drain. Toss with ½ tbsp olive oil and the chopped mint.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat ½ tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the eggs over medium-high heat until cooked to your liking. Divide the chips, onions, minted peas and pork loins between 4 plates. Drizzle the pork loins with any juice from the pan and top with an egg. Serve immediately.</li>
